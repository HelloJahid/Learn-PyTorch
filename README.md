# `Learn-PyTorch`

This repository contains material about pytorch from scratch to advanced. It consists of notebooks as well as python file for various deep learning topics. In most cases, the notebooks lead you through implementing models such as Linear Regression, Fully connected neural networks, Convolutional neural networks(CNN), recurrent neural networks(RNN), and GANs. There are other topics covered such as weight initialization and batch normalization.



# `PyTorch`
PyTorch is a small part of a computer software which is based on Torch library. It is a Deep Learning framework introduced by Facebook. PyTorch is a Machine Learning Library for Python programming language which is used for applications such as Natural Language Processing.

### The high-level features which are provided by PyTorch are as follows:

+ With the help of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), it gives tensor computing with strong acceleration.
- It provides Deep Neural Network which is built on a tape-based auto diff system.

PyTorch was developed to provide high flexibility and speed during implementing and building the Deep Learning Neural Network. As you already know, it is a machine learning library for Python programming language, so it's quite simple to install, run, and understand. Pytorch is completely pythonic (using widely adopted python idioms rather than writing Java and C++ code) so that it can quickly build a Neural Network Model successfully.
